# UFO Sightings Analysis

This is a small pet project analyzing a dataset on UFO sightings. The topic is weird, and that was the intention. I made this project not only to practice Python and Tableau, but also to create something interesting to explore.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle: [UFO Sightings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/data)

Data cleaning and preprocessing were done using Python (see ufo.ipynb). Visualization was created in Tableau. Both the Tableau workbook and a PDF export are included, but the easiest way to explore the dashboard is via this link:
[UFO Sightings Dashboard]([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pavlo.nadvoretskyi/viz/UFOSightings_17634062240790/Dashboard1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pavlo.nadvoretskyi/viz/UFOSightings_17638390135390/Dashboard1?publish=yes))

Hope you enjoy it)
